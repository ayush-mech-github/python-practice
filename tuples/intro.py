#data structure
#ordered collection of items
#tuples can store any datatype
#most importantly tuples are immutable
#once tuple is created we cannot update data inside it
#tuples are faster than lists

#no append,no insert, no pop, no remove

days=('monday','tuesday')
#they are used when we do not have to change data.

#methods
#count, index
